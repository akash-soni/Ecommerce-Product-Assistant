Seems the quality control has gone bad for nothing. So IP68 is a gimmick. Rating okayish for the price I had to pay.

itm0c32a18b0df8a,"Nothing Phone (3) (White, 512 GB)",4.4,60,"₹89,999","The price which I paid for 16/512 variant this is the best phone at that price. Happy with phone it is really premium and flagship in hand feel. || Very good performance 👏👏🎉 || Awesome!!! || People just hype that the phone is not worth.. being as a nothing phone user since 3 years I think this is worth upgrading 🥰. || Mobile is really good I'm happy with this. But also disappointed with delevery driver. He charge me 1200 extra without any reason. || Good worth pri || Don't look at the negative reviews...once you use the phone on a regular basis you will start loving the nothing OS. Camera I would say needs improvement and the glyph matrix has its own uses. Speakers are good. Battery lasts long. Played PUBG and CODM. Runs smooth in max graphics setting in both. Not worth the price it came out at but if you can get it for half the price it's an absolute bargain || Battery capacity is good,camra is sumthing good , gaming phone || Bought this Nothing Phone 3 in BBD offers, it's worth buying at this price range of 55k for High variant, I like the uniqueness of this phone. If getting at this price range and it's worth considering this phone. The only thing I'm a bit disappointed about is the bulky size and battery range is a bit low compared with other mobile brands. Nowadays flagship phones are coming with more than 6000mah battery but this mobile comes with 5500mah battery capacity. || Impressed 👍"
